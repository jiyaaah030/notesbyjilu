  - Replaced Link components with buttons for custom click handling
  - Added visual indicator for user's own profile in search results

## üéØ Smart Navigation Logic

- **Own Profile**: When user searches their own username ‚Üí navigates to `/profile`
- **Public Profile**: When users search other usernames ‚Üí navigates to `/profile/[firebaseUid]`
- **Visual Indicator**: Shows "(Your profile)" label for current user's search result

## üß™ Testing Required

- [ ] Test search functionality with own username vs other usernames
- [ ] Verify correct navigation for own vs other profiles
- [ ] Test visual indicator appears correctly
- [ ] Test with empty search results and edge cases

## üìù Next Steps

# User Follow/Unfollow System

## ‚úÖ Already Implemented & Working

- **Complete follow/unfollow functionality** is already implemented and working
  - Users can follow/unfollow other users from public profiles
  - Follower/following counts update in real-time
  - Users cannot follow themselves (proper validation)
  - Follow status is properly tracked and displayed

## üîß System Components

### **Backend Implementation** (`upload-server/routes/userRoutes.js`):

- **Follow Endpoint**: `POST /:firebaseUid/follow` - Follow a user
- **Unfollow Endpoint**: `DELETE /:firebaseUid/follow` - Unfollow a user
- **Status Check**: `GET /:firebaseUid/follow-status` - Check if following
- **User Model**: Already has `followers` and `following` arrays
- **Validation**: Prevents self-following and duplicate follows

### **Frontend API** (`src/app/api/users/[firebaseUid]/route.ts`):

- **GET with status=true**: Checks follow status for authenticated users
- **POST**: Handles follow requests with proper authentication
- **DELETE**: Handles unfollow requests with proper authentication
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all operations

### **Public Profile Page** (`src/app/profile/[id]/page.tsx`):

- **Follow/Unfollow Button**: Styled button that toggles between states
- **Real-time Counts**: Shows current follower/following numbers
- **Smart Display**: Only shows follow button for other users (not own profile)
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during follow actions
- **State Management**: Optimistic updates for better UX

## üéØ Features

### **User Experience**:

- **Intuitive Interface**: Clear follow/unfollow button with proper styling
- **Visual Feedback**: Button changes color and text based on follow status
- **Count Display**: Shows follower/following counts prominently
- **Self-Protection**: Users cannot follow themselves
- **Real-time Updates**: Counts update immediately after follow/unfollow

### **Technical Features**:

- **Authentication**: All actions require valid Firebase authentication
- **Data Consistency**: Atomic operations ensure data integrity
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback
- **Performance**: Efficient database queries and updates
- **Security**: Proper validation and authorization checks

## üß™ Testing Required

- [ ] Test follow/unfollow functionality with different users
- [ ] Verify follower/following counts update correctly
- [ ] Test edge cases (following non-existent users, etc.)
- [ ] Test authentication requirements
- [ ] Test UI updates and loading states

## üìù Next Steps

- Monitor follow system performance in production
- Consider adding follow notifications
- Add follower/following lists to user profiles
- Consider adding "mutual follows" feature
- Add analytics for follow patterns
