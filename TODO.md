# Upload Authentication Fix

## ✅ Completed

- **Fixed "Missing token" error in upload functionality**
  - Added Firebase ID token retrieval in frontend upload request
  - Added Authorization header with Bearer token format
  - Backend authentication middleware now receives required token

## 🔧 Changes Made

- **File**: `src/app/upload/page.tsx`
  - Added `const idToken = await user.getIdToken();` before form submission
  - Added `Authorization: Bearer ${idToken}` header to fetch request
  - This allows the backend `verifyFirebaseToken` middleware to authenticate the user

## 🧪 Testing Required

- [ ] Test upload functionality with authenticated user
- [ ] Verify token is properly sent in Authorization header
- [ ] Confirm backend successfully verifies token and processes upload
- [ ] Test error handling for invalid/expired tokens

## 📝 Next Steps

- Monitor upload functionality in production
- Consider adding token refresh logic if needed
- Add proper error handling for token-related failures
