   BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001

   # MongoDB connection string
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/notesdb

   # Firebase service account key (JSON string)
   FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY={"type":"service_account","project_id":"..."}

   # Google API key for Vertex AI
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
   ```

   Create `.env` in the `upload-server` directory:

   ```env
   # MongoDB connection string
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/notesdb

   # Firebase service account key file path
   FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE=./firebase-service-account.json

   # Google API key for Vertex AI
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key

   # CORS origins (comma-separated)
   CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001

   # Server port
   PORT=3001
   ```

5. **Set up Firebase**

   - Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com/
   - Enable Authentication with Email/Password provider
   - Download the service account key JSON file and place it in `upload-server/firebase-service-account.json`
   - Update Firebase config in `src/lib/firebase.ts` with your project credentials

6. **Set up Google Cloud Vertex AI**

   - Create a Google Cloud project
   - Enable Vertex AI API
   - Generate an API key and add it to your environment variables

### Running the Application

1. **Start the backend server**

   ```bash
   cd upload-server
   npm start
   ```

   The backend will run on http://localhost:3001

2. **Start the frontend development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend will run on http://localhost:3000

3. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

### Testing

Run the test suite for the backend:

```bash
cd upload-server
npm test
```

### Deployment

The application is configured for deployment on Vercel (frontend) and any Node.js hosting service (backend).

For Vercel deployment:

- Set the environment variables in your Vercel project settings
